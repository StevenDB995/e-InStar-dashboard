A web-based dashboard developed to track the **production**, **logistics**, and **installation** status of components in a BIM (Building Information Modelling) project for **iLab @ The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**.

## 🛠️ Overview

The dashboard provides a centralised interface for stakeholders to:

- Monitor real-time progress of modular construction elements
- Visualise logistics updates across different supply and transport stages
- Track on-site installation status and completion timelines

## 🔍 Features

- 📦 **Production Tracking**: Displays manufacturing progress of each building module
- 🚚 **Logistics Monitoring**: Shows transport status and routes on map
- 🏗️ **Installation Updates**: Visualises installation process by animated 3D model
- 📊 **Data Visualisation**: Interactive charts and 3D model for clear project insights
